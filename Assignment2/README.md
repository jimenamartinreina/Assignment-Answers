These are the files for the second Assignment of the course.

Authors: David García Valcarce and Jimena Martín Reina.

There is one principal script and three auxiliar scripts required for the task.

Write $ruby main.rb in the terminal for running the code.
Make sure all the files are in the directory of the terminal.

The code needs the file "ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt", and gives two output files:

- One is for the interactions found in pairs in the total of genes on the list given: "interactions.txt".

- The other one is the report of the networks found, with the KEGG/GO annotations of those networks: "report.txt".
