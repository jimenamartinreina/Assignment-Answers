These are the files for the second assignment of Bioinformatics Programming Challenges.

Authors: David García Valcarce and Jimena Martín Reina.

There is one principal script ("main.rb") and three auxiliar scripts ("Interactions.rb","Network.rb" and "Annotations.rb") required for the task.

Write $ruby main.rb in the terminal for running the code.
Make sure all the files are in the current directory.

The code needs the file "ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt", and returns two output files:

- One is for the interactions found in pairs in the total of genes on the given list: "interactions.txt".

- The other one is the report of the networks found, with the KEGG/GO annotations of those networks: "report.txt".
